# How to Test the Offline Fix - Step by Step

## CRITICAL FIX APPLIED (v8) - 503 Error RESOLVED!

**Latest Fix:** Service worker was blocking Next.js development chunks causing 503 errors.
- Updated to **v8** to skip all `/_next/static/chunks/` files
- Service worker now lets browser handle development files directly
- No more "ERR_ABORTED 503" or "Failed to load chunk" errors!

## Previous Issues Fixed:
- The "Cannot assign to read only property 'name'" error is from **Next.js development tools**, not the service worker
- The 503 errors were from service worker intercepting Next.js Turbopack chunks

## Step 1: Disable DevTools Exception Pausing

1. In Chrome DevTools, click the **Sources** tab
2. Look for the pause icon (two vertical bars ||) in the top right
3. **Click it until it's grayed out** (not blue/purple)
4. **Uncheck "Pause on caught exceptions"** in the right sidebar
5. **Uncheck "Pause on uncaught exceptions"**

## Step 2: Unregister OLD Service Worker

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **Service Workers** in left sidebar
4. Find the service worker entry
5. Click **Unregister** button
6. **DO NOT REFRESH YET**

## Step 3: Clear ALL Caches

1. Still in **Application** tab
2. Click **Cache Storage** in left sidebar
3. **Right-click on each cache** (cardiac-delights-v6, v5, v4, etc.)
4. Click **Delete** for each one
5. Make sure ALL caches are deleted

## Step 4: Clear IndexedDB (Optional but Recommended)

1. Still in **Application** tab
2. Click **IndexedDB** in left sidebar
3. Right-click **cardiac-delights-db**
4. Click **Delete database**

## Step 5: Hard Refresh

1. Close DevTools
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows) or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac)
3. This forces a complete page reload without cache

## Step 6: Verify New Service Worker (v8) Installed

1. Open DevTools again (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for this message:
   ```
   ✅ Enhanced SW registered with offline CRUD: http://localhost:3000/
   ```
4. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure there are NO 503 errors or "Failed to load chunk" errors
5. Go to **Application** → **Service Workers**
6. Verify it shows `service-worker.js` with status "activated"

## Step 7: Navigate While ONLINE (Critical!)

1. Make sure **Network** tab shows you're online (NOT throttled)
2. Navigate to different pages:
   - Click **Dashboard**
   - Click **Inventory**
   - Click **Menu**
3. **Watch the Console** for this message:
   ```
   [SW] Navigation network success: http://localhost:3000/Features/Inventory
   [SW] ✅ Cached root page as app shell (from /Features/Inventory)
   ```

## Step 8: Verify Cache Storage Has Root Page

1. Go to **Application** → **Cache Storage**
2. Click on **cardiac-delights-v8**
3. You should see an entry for:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/
   ```
4. This is the cached root page (app shell)

## Step 9: Test OFFLINE Navigation

1. Go to **Network** tab
2. Change dropdown from "No throttling" to **Offline**
3. Try navigating to different pages:
   - Go to **Dashboard**
   - Go to **Inventory**
   - Go to **Menu**
4. **Check Console** for:
   ```
   [SW] Navigation network failed, trying cache: TypeError: Failed to fetch
   [SW] Offline - serving app shell for: /Features/Dashboard
   [SW] App shell found, serving for: /Features/Dashboard
   [SW] Serving from API cache: http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard/low-stock
   ```
5. **Pages should load!** No black screen!

## Expected Results

### When Online ✅
- Service worker v8 registered
- NO 503 errors or "Failed to load chunk" errors
- Root page cached automatically when navigating
- API data cached via DataPreloader
- Console shows: `[SW] ✅ Cached root page as app shell (from /Features/Inventory)`

### When Offline ✅
- Pages navigate without black screen
- Data loads from cache
- Console shows: `[SW] App shell found, serving for: /Features/Dashboard`

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing TypeError about "read only property 'name'"?

**This is NOT a service worker error!** This is from Next.js dev tools.

**Solution:**
1. **Ignore it** - it doesn't affect functionality
2. **Disable "Pause on exceptions"** in DevTools Sources tab
3. **Click the Resume button** (▶) if debugger pauses
4. The error is in Next.js internal code, not your app

### Still seeing black screen?

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you navigated **while ONLINE first** (Step 7)
2. Check Cache Storage has root page `/` cached (Step 8)
3. Make sure Network tab shows "Offline" when testing (Step 9)
4. Check Console for the app shell logs

### Still seeing 503 errors or "Failed to load chunk"?

**Solution:**
1. Make sure service worker v8 is installed (not v7 or v6)
2. Unregister old service workers completely
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check that service worker is skipping `/_next/static/chunks/` files

### Root page not being cached?

**Solution:**
1. Make sure service worker v8 is installed (not v7 or v6)
2. Navigate to **any page** while online (Dashboard, Inventory, Menu)
3. Check Console immediately after navigation - should see the cache log
4. If you don't see the log, the service worker might not be active yet

### Service worker not updating?

**Solution:**
1. **Unregister ALL service workers** (Step 2)
2. **Delete ALL caches** (Step 3)
3. Close the tab completely
4. Open new tab to `http://localhost:3000`
5. Check service worker version in Application tab

## What If It Still Doesn't Work?

If after following ALL steps above it still doesn't work:

1. **Check service worker file** was actually updated to v8
   - Open `public/service-worker.js`
   - Line 1 should say: `const CACHE_NAME = "cardiac-delights-v8";`
   - Lines 141-151 should have the code that skips Next.js chunks

2. **Check if Next.js is running**
   - Make sure `npm run dev` is running in terminal
   - Make sure no errors in terminal

3. **Try production build** (development mode has limitations)
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

4. **Take screenshots** and show:
   - Console logs
   - Network tab showing offline
   - Application → Service Workers
   - Application → Cache Storage
   - The actual page showing black screen or working
