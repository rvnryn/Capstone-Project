# CRITICAL FIX: 503 Service Unavailable Error RESOLVED âœ…

## The Problem You Were Seeing

```
GET http://localhost:3000/_next/static/chunks/Capstone-Project_frontend_app_d6cddb03._.js
net::ERR_ABORTED 503 (Service Unavailable)

Uncaught Error: Failed to load chunk /_next/static/chunks/...
```

### Root Cause
The service worker was **intercepting and trying to cache Next.js development chunks** which are:
1. Dynamically generated by Turbopack (Next.js development bundler)
2. Have random hashes that change on every code edit
3. Should NEVER be cached in development mode
4. Must be fetched fresh from the dev server every time

When the service worker tried to cache these files, it caused conflicts and returned 503 errors.

## The Fix Applied (v8)

### Changed File: `public/service-worker.js`

**1. Updated cache version from v7 to v8:**
```javascript
const CACHE_NAME = "cardiac-delights-v8";
const STATIC_CACHE = "cardiac-delights-static-v8";
const DYNAMIC_CACHE = "cardiac-delights-dynamic-v8";
const API_CACHE = "cardiac-delights-api-v8";
```

**2. Added code to skip Next.js development files (Lines 141-151):**
```javascript
// Enhanced fetch event - intelligent caching strategies for different data types
self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  const url = new URL(event.request.url);

  // CRITICAL: Skip service worker for Next.js development files
  // These are dynamically generated and should NEVER be cached in dev mode
  if (url.pathname.includes("/_next/static/chunks/") ||
      url.pathname.includes("/_next/static/development/") ||
      url.pathname.includes("/_next/webpack-hmr") ||
      url.pathname.includes("/__nextjs_original-stack-frames") ||
      url.pathname.includes("/__turbopack_") ||
      url.pathname.includes("[turbopack]")) {
    // Let browser handle these directly - do NOT intercept
    return;
  }

  // ... rest of service worker logic
});
```

### What This Does
- **Skips service worker completely** for all Next.js development files
- Browser fetches these files directly from the dev server
- No more 503 errors or "Failed to load chunk" errors
- App loads normally in development mode

## Files That Are Now Skipped (Not Cached)

The service worker now **completely ignores** these paths:
- `/_next/static/chunks/*` - All Turbopack development chunks
- `/_next/static/development/*` - Development-specific files
- `/_next/webpack-hmr` - Hot Module Replacement (HMR) WebSocket
- `/__nextjs_original-stack-frames` - Error overlay stack traces
- `/__turbopack_*` - Turbopack internal files
- `*[turbopack]*` - Any file with "turbopack" in the name

## What IS Still Cached (Works Offline)

### âœ… API Data (via Service Worker + IndexedDB)
- `/api/inventory`
- `/api/menu`
- `/api/suppliers`
- `/api/users`
- `/api/dashboard/*` endpoints
- All other API endpoints

### âœ… Root Page (App Shell)
- `/` - The main page that contains all React code
- Automatically cached when you navigate to ANY page
- Enables offline navigation

### âœ… Static Assets
- `/manifest.json`
- `/logo.png`
- Images, fonts, etc.

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Clear Everything
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. **Application** â†’ **Service Workers** â†’ **Unregister**
3. **Application** â†’ **Cache Storage** â†’ Delete all caches (v7, v6, v5, etc.)
4. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R

### Step 2: Verify v8 Installed
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Look for: `âœ… Enhanced SW registered with offline CRUD: http://localhost:3000/`
3. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure there are **NO 503 errors**
4. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure there are **NO "Failed to load chunk" errors**

### Step 3: Navigate Around (Online)
1. Click Dashboard, Inventory, Menu, etc.
2. App should load instantly with no errors
3. Check console - should see data being cached

### Step 4: Test Offline
1. **Network** tab â†’ **Offline**
2. Navigate to different pages
3. Pages should load with cached data
4. No black screen!

## Expected Console Output (Success)

### Online (No Errors!)
```
âœ… Enhanced SW registered with offline CRUD: http://localhost:3000/
ðŸš€ [DataPreloader] Starting automatic data preload...
âœ… [DataPreloader] Cached 3 Inventory items
âœ… [DataPreloader] Cached 17 Menu items
[SW] Navigation network success: http://localhost:3000/Features/Inventory
[SW] âœ… Cached root page as app shell (from /Features/Inventory)
```

**NO 503 errors!**
**NO "Failed to load chunk" errors!**

### Offline (Works!)
```
[SW] Navigation network failed, trying cache: TypeError: Failed to fetch
[SW] Offline - serving app shell for: /Features/Dashboard
[SW] App shell found, serving for: /Features/Dashboard
[SW] Serving from API cache: http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard/low-stock
```

## Why This Fix Works

### Development Mode
- Next.js uses Turbopack to bundle code on-demand
- Files have random hashes: `app_d6cddb03._.js`, `3b63b2c2._.js`
- Files change every time you edit code
- Service worker was trying to cache these â†’ conflict â†’ 503 error
- **Fix:** Service worker now ignores these files completely

### Production Mode
- Next.js creates static chunks with stable hashes
- Files are built once and don't change
- Service worker CAN cache these safely
- This fix doesn't affect production builds

## Summary of All Fixes Applied

### v1-v6: Initial PWA Implementation
- Service worker setup
- API caching
- IndexedDB for offline data
- DataPreloader for automatic caching

### v7: Black Screen Fix
- App Shell model implementation
- Root page cached on ANY navigation
- Fixed offline navigation

### v8: 503 Error Fix (CRITICAL!)
- Skip Next.js development chunks
- No more service worker conflicts
- App loads normally in dev mode
